# Reptoads
A game project made in 8 weeks. This project is based on the tomorrow engine (inclueded) which also is a 8 week project for a turnd based card game engine. The game itself is determistic.

This project is not functional at this point in time because important components are missing due to license reasons. We published this codebase that others can learn from it.
